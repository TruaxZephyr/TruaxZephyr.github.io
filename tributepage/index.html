            <li id="list-one">Naval Medical Center San Diego, also known as Bob Wilson Naval Hospital.</li>
            <li id="list-two">Development: As the United States entered World War I, San Diegans offered the nearly 
                empty Balboa Park after the 1915 Panamaâ€“California Exposition to be used by various branches of 
                the U.S. military for barracks and training purposes. During this time, a hospital tent 
                was set up at the present location of the San Diego Natural History Museum. In September 1919, 
                city leaders set aside a 17-acre (6.9 ha) parcel at Inspiration Point in Balboa Park for use 
                in constructing a permanent Naval hospital. About $1.25 million was appropriated for the 
                construction of the hospital; which would supplement the medical services provided aboard a fleet 
                assigned hospital ship. This donation, along with other purchased land, allowed for the 
                development of an 85-acre (34 ha), 89-building complex with 2,600 beds. The first unit opened in 1925</li>
            <li id="list-three">Current Status: The center has five medical mobilization teams including the hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH-19) 
                whose personnel are drawn from the hospital staff. These teams deploy to the Western Pacific and 
                Southeast Asia at various times during the year.
                The hospital is a major training facility associated with the Uniformed Services University of 
                Health Sciences. The hospital is affiliated with the University of California, San Diego, 
                Children's Hospital and Health Center, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla a
                nd other institutions where Navy trainees perform rotations as integral parts of their residency 
                or fellowship programs. The hospital also maintains a school on the grounds for training 
                enlisted medical personnel.</li>
            <li id="list-four">Research and Testing: A leader in the medical field, the hospital is also a major teaching and research center.
                As one of Navy medicine's active teaching hospital, graduate medical education programs are 
                conducted in anesthesiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, 
                obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, pathology, pediatrics, 
                psychiatry, psychology, radiology, urology, general practice dentistry, oral and maxillofacial 
                surgery, nurse anesthesia, and hospital pharmacy.</li>
            <li id="list-five">Namesake: On May 8, 2008, the hospital Medical Center San Diego was dedicated to San Diego Congressman Bob Wilson. 
                The main entrance road leading to the hospital grounds is also named for him, Bob Wilson Drive.</li>
